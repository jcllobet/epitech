The homework for today is split into two parts:
- Hierarchical Clustering
- K-means implementation from scratch

# 01 - Hierarchical Clustering
It is a series of short notebooks to test your understanding via jupyter notebooks
## How to run the notebooks

- Launch an executable version of a notebook in [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Google account needed) by opening it and clicking this button: ![Open In Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)

- Download this exercises and run a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook server on your local machine, then **push them to github**.

# 02 K-means Implementation from scratch
Read the associated [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vOKyDRe6mIBTFhdq8d_PfQSfqz_H5dWL/view) and review the [class slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h4PLEhmDoN6WmCGzra40zyIYP9O5FqWTICJMvy_YAl4/edit). Additionally, you have a functional demo of kmeans working [here](https://github.com/jcllobet/akademy_teachers_repo/blob/master/03.%20Machine%20Learning/03.%20Clustering/exercises/02.%20Partitional%20Algorithms/plot_kmeans_digits.ipynb) as well as a [guided notebook.](https://github.com/jcllobet/akademy_teachers_repo/blob/master/03.%20Machine%20Learning/03.%20Clustering/exercises/02.%20Partitional%20Algorithms/KMeans_Guided_Notebook.ipynb)
